Implementation Timeline & Phases
Phase 1: Core Backend (1 hour)
Goal: Basic FastAPI server with prompt evaluation endpoint

FastAPI setup with CORS
Pydantic models for requests/responses
Single LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation function
Basic error handling

Phase 2: Frontend Foundation (45 minutes)
Goal: React app that can submit prompts and display results

Create React app with TypeScript
Basic form for inputting prompts and test question
Results table showing scores
API integration with error states

Phase 3: Evaluation Enhancement (45 minutes)
Goal: Multiple evaluation criteria and parallel execution

Configurable evaluation criteria (accuracy, safety, helpfulness)
Parallel prompt evaluation
Weighted scoring system
Progress indicators

Phase 4: Comparison UI (30 minutes)
Goal: Head-to-head comparison interface

Select two prompts for comparison
Split-screen comparison view
Metric breakdown visualization
Example output differences

Testing Strategy:

Backend: Test with 2-3 simple prompts, verify scoring consistency
Frontend: Test with mock data first, then real API integration
End-to-end: Run actual evaluation with different prompt styles
